## Background
I initiated this project to build a dedicated space that functions as both a professional resume and a technical archive. The goal was to migrate away from third-party platforms and create a self-hosted environment where I could document my engineering journey with full architectural control.

## Technical Decisions
- **Next.js 16**: Leveraged the latest features of Next.js to ensure high performance and experiment with cutting-edge React patterns.
- **Styled Components**: Adopted a CSS-in-JS approach to manage component-scoped styles effectively. This allowed for dynamic styling based on props and a cleaner separation of concerns within React components.
- **Storybook**: Integrated to manage and document UI components in isolation, ensuring visual consistency and reusability across the site.
- **Contentlayer2**: Automated the content pipeline to turn MDX-based project logs into structured data.
