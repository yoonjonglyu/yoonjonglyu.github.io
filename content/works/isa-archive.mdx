  description: >
    Designed and implemented a UI-architecture–centric portfolio platform that treats resumes and work logs
    as programmatic structured data rather than static pages. The system emphasizes component isolation, 
    predictable styling, and reusable layout primitives to support long-term scalability.
  skills:
    - Next.js
    - Storybook
    - Contentlayer
    - TypeScript
    - Styled Components
    - Design System

highlights:
  - Structured all UI around a Component-Driven Development workflow, ensuring every layout and UI primitive is independently testable and reusable.
  - Architected a design system with strict style encapsulation using CSS-in-JS to prevent global leakage and layout coupling.
  - Separated content structure from presentation by introducing a typed content schema layer, enabling UI components to remain data-agnostic.
  - Optimized UI scalability by standardizing layout contracts (section, block, highlight), eliminating the need for page-specific styling.

## Background

Traditional portfolio sites often degrade over time due to tightly coupled layouts, ad-hoc styling rules, and content-specific components.
This project was conceived as an experiment in treating a personal archive as a **UI system**, not just a collection of pages.

The goal was to validate whether a resume and work history could be modeled as structured data rendered through
stable, reusable UI primitives.

## Architectural Focus

### Component-Driven UI Structure

Instead of building pages directly, the entire UI is composed from isolated components defined and verified in Storybook.
Each component represents a stable contract—where layout, spacing, typography, and interaction rules are fixed at the component level.

This approach ensures:
- Predictable UI behavior regardless of content changes.
- Safe iteration on layout without page-level regressions.
- Clear separation between data structure and visual styling.

---

### Styling Isolation & Predictability

Styled Components were adopted to enforce strict style encapsulation.
No global CSS rules or implicit inheritance are relied upon, ensuring high maintainability.

Key outcomes:
- Zero class name collisions.
- Theme-level control over color, spacing, and typography.
- Consistent rendering across layout variants.

---

### Data-Driven Rendering Layer

Contentlayer is used to model resumes, work entries, and archives as typed data.
UI components consume normalized data shapes rather than page-specific props.

This allows:
- Reusing the same UI components for various views (resume, work, archive).
- Rendering different content densities without duplicating layout logic.
- Long-term extensibility without refactoring the UI layer.

---

## Result

The project functions as both a personal archive and a validation of a UI-architecture approach
where **components, not pages, are the primary unit of design**.

This structure enables the archive to grow without increasing UI complexity,
making it suitable as a long-term professional record rather than a static showcase.
